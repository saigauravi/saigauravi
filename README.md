<p>As a computer science graduate with a passion for solving complex problems and building scalable applications, I have developed strong expertise in both front-end and back-end development. With a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and system design, I have hands-on experience working with microservices architecture, REST APIs, and enterprise-grade software solutions.

My skill set includes proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, Angular, React, MySQL, and MongoDB. I have a track record of implementing efficient, high-quality features such as dynamic admin panels, task management systems, and seamless payment solutions. Additionally, I enjoy collaborating in agile environments using tools like Git, Jenkins, and JIRA, and am always eager to learn and adapt to emerging technologies.

I am confident in my ability to deliver impactful solutions and excited to contribute to innovative projects that drive value and make a difference. Let’s collaborate to bring ideas to life!</p>
